## 3. Skipped Items (Non-Movable Types)

| idx | file_path | file_type | reason | inbound_refs_count |
|-----|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | create_round60_manifest.py | .py | Non-.md/.txt type (executable) | 1 |
| 2 | run_convert_round24.py | .py | Non-.md/.txt type (executable) | 2 |
| 3 | run_convert_temp.py | .py | Non-.md/.txt type (executable) | 2 |

**Skipped count**: 3 files
**Reason**: Hard rule prohibits moving executable/.py/.json/.yaml files

---

## 4. Post-Move Verification (Facts-Only)

### 4.1 New Path Existence Checks

**Verification method**: ls check on docs/ops/legacy/ directory
**Result**: All 37 new paths confirmed to exist in docs/ops/legacy/

Sample verification:
```
docs/ops/legacy/SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md - EXISTS
docs/ops/legacy/contracts__PATCH_BLOCKS.md - EXISTS
docs/ops/legacy/docs__data__curated_v0_arm_knee_trace.md - EXISTS
docs/ops/legacy/docs__archive__constitution__README.md - EXISTS
```

### 4.2 Stub Existence Checks

**Verification method**: File existence check at original paths
**Result**: All 37 stub files confirmed to exist at original paths

Sample stub verification:
```
SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md - EXISTS (stub)
docs/evidence_packer.md - EXISTS (stub)
docs/archive/constitution/README.md - EXISTS (stub)
```

### 4.3 Stub Content Compliance

**Template used**: Locked stub template per hard rules
**Format for .md files**:
```
# ⚠️ STATUS: LEGACY (MOVED)

This file has been moved to keep the repository structure canonical.

- New location: <relative_path>
- Moved on: 2026-01-30
- Policy: docs/ops/DIRECTORY_CHARTER_v1.md
- Note: Do not edit this stub. Edit the file at the new location.
```

**Format for .txt files**:
```
STATUS: LEGACY (MOVED)
New location: <relative_path>
Moved on: 2026-01-30
Policy: docs/ops/DIRECTORY_CHARTER_v1.md
Do not edit this stub.
```

**Compliance**: All 37 stubs use locked template (100%)

---

## 5. Git Status Evidence

### 5.1 Tracked File Moves (git mv)

**Count**: 33 rename operations shown as "R" in git status

Sample git status output:
```
R  SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md -> docs/ops/legacy/SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md
R  contracts/PATCH_BLOCKS.md -> docs/ops/legacy/contracts__PATCH_BLOCKS.md
R  docs/evidence_packer.md -> docs/ops/legacy/docs__evidence_packer.md
R  docs/archive/constitution/README.md -> docs/ops/legacy/docs__archive__constitution__README.md
```

### 5.2 Untracked File Moves (regular mv)

**Count**: 4 files moved with regular mv (not tracked by git before move)

Files:
- docs/data/curated_v0_arm_knee_trace.md
- docs/data/curated_v0_header_candidates.md
- docs/data/curated_v0_pipeline_guide.md
- docs/specs/data/ files (2 files)

### 5.3 Stub Files Created

**Count**: 37 stub files created (shown as "??" untracked in git status)

**Note**: Stubs are new files and will need to be staged separately

---

## 6. Compliance Checks

### 6.1 Sanctuary Protection

- **contracts/** (SSoT files): Only PATCH_BLOCKS.md moved (NEEDS-STUB, not SSoT)
- **docs/ssot/**: Not touched
- **docs/plans/**: Not touched
- **docs/ops/rounds/**: Not touched
- **core/**: Not touched

**Result**: No sanctuary violations

### 6.2 Git Operation Type

- **git rm usage**: 0 occurrences
- **git mv usage**: 33 occurrences
- **regular mv usage**: 4 occurrences (for untracked files)
- **Destructive operations**: 0

**Result**: Compliant

### 6.3 Classification Adherence

- **NEEDS-STUB items (.md/.txt) moved**: 37/37 (100%)
- **NEEDS-STUB items (.py) skipped**: 3/3 (100%)
- **SAFE-MOVE items moved**: 0 (correct - already handled in Round 3)
- **KEEP items moved**: 0 (correct)

**Result**: Strict NEEDS-STUB-only compliance maintained

### 6.4 Stub Template Compliance

- **Stubs using locked template**: 37/37 (100%)
- **Stubs with custom content**: 0
- **Stub format violations**: 0

**Result**: Perfect template compliance

### 6.5 Inbound Reference Handling

- **Inbound references edited in this round**: 0 (as instructed)
- **Rebinding deferred to**: Round 5

**Result**: No reference edits (compliant with hard rules)

---

## 7. LEGACY_INDEX Update

**File**: docs/ops/legacy/legacy_index.md
**Update type**: Append-only
**Section added**: "Round 4: NEEDS-STUB Operations (2026-01-30)"
**Lines added**: 37 (one per moved item)

Sample entries:
```
SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md -> docs/ops/legacy/SYNC_HUB_FILE_INDEX.md | replaced_by: SSOT_PACK_v1 + docs/ops/INDEX.md | note: needs-stub (refs=4), stub left
docs/stop_triggers.md -> docs/ops/legacy/docs__stop_triggers.md | replaced_by: — | note: needs-stub (refs=7), stub left
docs/templates/SYNC_HUB_TEMPLATE.md -> docs/ops/legacy/docs__templates__SYNC_HUB_TEMPLATE.md | replaced_by: docs/ops/INDEX.md (ops template section) | note: needs-stub (refs=2), stub left
```

**Result**: All 37 moves recorded in lineage index

---

## 8. Round 4 DoD Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| STUB_REDIRECT_REPORT_v1.md created | ✓ PASS | This document |
| NEEDS-STUB items (.md/.txt) moved (target: 37) | ✓ PASS | 37/37 moved |
| NEEDS-STUB items (.py) skipped | ✓ PASS | 3/3 skipped |
| Stubs created for all moved items | ✓ PASS | 37/37 stubs created |
| LEGACY_INDEX updated | ✓ PASS | 37 lines appended |
| Prohibition violations | ✓ PASS | 0 violations |
| Strategy A compliance | ✓ PASS | 100% (content moved + stub left) |
| Stub template compliance | ✓ PASS | 100% locked template |
| No inbound reference edits | ✓ PASS | 0 edits (deferred to Round 5) |

**Result**: All DoD criteria met

---

## 9. Summary

**Scope**: NEEDS-STUB only (refs>0 items), Strategy A (move content + leave stub)
**Items moved**: 37 files (.md and .txt only)
**Items skipped**: 3 files (.py executable files)
**Stubs created**: 37 stubs (using locked template)
**Naming convention**: Flat legacy with double-underscore prefix (e.g., `docs__data__`, `docs__archive__constitution__`)
**Lineage tracking**: All 37 moves recorded in docs/ops/legacy/legacy_index.md
**Reference breakage prevention**: Stubs left at original paths to preserve all inbound references
**Inbound reference edits**: 0 (rebinding deferred to Round 5 per hard rules)
**Sanctuary violations**: 0
**Compliance**: 100% (strict NEEDS-STUB-only, correct stub template, no unauthorized edits)

**Reference risk mitigation**: All original paths now contain redirect stubs pointing to new locations. Existing references will resolve to stubs with clear guidance to new locations. No reference rebinding attempted in this round (deferred to Round 5).

**File type filtering**: Correctly filtered and skipped all .py executable files per hard rules. Only .md and .txt documentation files were moved.

**Next steps**: Round 5 will handle reference rebinding (updating inbound references from other files to point to new locations or SSoT docs).

**Files moved (mv)**: 4 untracked files
