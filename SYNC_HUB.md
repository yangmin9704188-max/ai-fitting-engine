# SYNC HUB

## Project Identity
- Project: AI Fitting Engine
- Mode: Lightweight R&D (Single Developer)
- Core Principle: Definition → Implementation → Run → Judgment are separated

---

## Current Focus
- Track: MVP-1 (Logic Core | Measurement)
- Layer:
  - [ ] Semantic (Definition)
  - [ ] Geometry (Implementation)
  - [ ] Validation (Execution / Sensing Risk)

---

## Today’s Objective (One Only)
- Objective:
  - (예: A-Pose Normalization v1.2에서 arm angle 정의 명확화)

---

## Last Completed Output
- Type:
  - Policy | Spec | Run | Report
- Reference:
  - (파일 경로 또는 이름)
- Summary:
  - (한 줄 요약)

---

## Current Observations
- What seems unstable or unclear?
  - (수치, 정의, 실행 중 하나)

---

## Known Risks (If Any)
- When should this NOT be used?
  - (모르면 비워둔다)

---

## Next Action (Concrete)
- Next step:
  - (다음에 할 “하나의 행동”)

---

## Notes for AI
- Do NOT:
  - mix judgment into Run
  - redesign system architecture
- Focus on:
  - current layer only
